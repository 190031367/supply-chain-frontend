Customer Demands Affect Supply Chain Logistics Certainly, supply chain logistics must run smoothly and efficiently enough to satisfy customers and suppliers. The challenge comes in when customer demands become taxing on the entire supply chain. In some cases, customers demand more transparency into the logistics processes themselves.

Creating dynamic, cost-effective, productive warehouse, logistics, and inventory processes is more feasible when supply chain logistics include best practices in inventory management.

In fact, it is the insight provided by inventory management and tracking that helps supply chain logistics executives maintain effective supply chain visibility.
